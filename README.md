# Welcome to My Personal Website () => [arnabsamanta.in](https://arnabsamanta.in/)

Hey there! Welcome to my GitHub repository where I showcase my personal website built using React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. This website is my creative space where I express myself, showcase my projects, and share my journey as a first-year student in the world of web development.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** The frontend of my website is built using React, a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite:** Vite is a fast and opinionated frontend build tool that I used to develop my website. Its blazing fast development server and build times made the development process smooth and efficient.
- **Tailwind CSS:** To style my website, I utilized Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework that helped me design responsive and visually appealing components with ease.

## Deployment

My website is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), a powerful platform for hosting static websites. You can access my website live at [arnabsamanta.in](https://arnabsamanta.in/).
