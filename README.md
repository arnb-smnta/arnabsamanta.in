# Welcome to My Personal Website

Hello and welcome to my GitHub repository! Here, I showcase my personal website, built with **React**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS**. This site serves as my creative platform to express myself, display my projects, and share my journey as a first-year web development student.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **React:** A powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces that drive the frontend of my website.
- **Vite:** A fast and opinionated build tool that enabled a smooth development experience with its lightning-fast server and build times.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework that made it easy to design responsive, visually appealing components.

## 🌐 Deployment

My website is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), providing a seamless experience for static site hosting. Check it out live at [arnabsamanta.in](https://arnabsamanta.in/).

## ✨ Features

- **About Me:** Learn more about my interests, skills, and aspirations in the "About Me" section.
